<p><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Lexend,sans-serif;">This is often the most challenging stage to secure funding, as startups are typically unproven with little to no revenue. However, several options are available:</span></p>

    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Lexend,sans-serif;">

    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Lexend,sans-serif;">
