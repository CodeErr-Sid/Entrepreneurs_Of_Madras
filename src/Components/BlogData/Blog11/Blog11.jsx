                In this article, we’ll talk about a lead gen method that is GUARANTEED to get you more leads.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a simple two-step method that can be applied to pretty much ANY business.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">
                You’re here for results. Sales, profit, and growth. So let’s get to it.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">The Problem: Quantity Over Quality</h4>
            <p className="mt-4">
                Just talking about your business everywhere (one step) may seem like it’s working. Sure, your email would grow. You get impressions. You get attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what good is it if it’s stuffed with people who barely remember signing up,
                or people who are just scrolling through and won’t ever become your clients.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some statistics to chew on:</p>
            <p className="font-bold">
                61% of marketers say generating traffic and leads is their biggest challenge
            </p>
            <p className="italic">(HubSpot, 2023).</p>
            <p>
                Even worse, <strong>79% of leads NEVER convert into sales</strong>
                <span className="italic"> (MarketingSherpa).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s one common reason why these happen. Most businesses just throw themselves out there and talk to leads who are not QUALIFIED.
            </p>
            <p>They’re not ready to buy, and you’re wasting time trying to convince them.</p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">Now see what bad leads cost you</h4>
            <p>
                Bad leads are a leaky bucket. Pour all you want, it’s never enough.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s what it’s really costing you:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>
                    <strong>Time:</strong> You’re wasting hours chasing leads who’ll never buy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Money:</strong> Every bad lead drains your budget. Ads, email campaigns, all down the drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Morale:</strong> Frustrated salespeople, demoralized marketing teams, and a whole lot of wheel-spinning (without going anywhere).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
                If your lead-gen process is broken, you’re setting yourself up for failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study by HubSpot found that <strong>only 22% of businesses are satisfied with their conversion rates</strong>
                <span className="italic"> (Source: HubSpot, 2023).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most businesses screw up by chasing the wrong audience, tracking useless metrics, and sending the wrong message.
            </p>
            <p>So what do you have to do now?</p>
             <br />
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">The Two-Step Lead Generation Method</h3>
            <p>
                The two-step method is about locking onto the leads who actually “matter”. Here’s how it works:
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">Step One: Offer Value First</h4>
            <p>
                This is where most people screw up. Instead of going everywhere and screaming all about your business like what we saw above,
                <strong> Offer something your audience actually wants.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                A <strong>2023 survey</strong> showed that <strong>63% of consumers are willing to trade their email address for valuable content</strong>
                <span className="italic"> (Demand Gen Report).</span>
            </p>
            <p>So, give them what they want:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>A guide that solves their biggest problem.</li>
                <li>A checklist that saves them time or money.</li>
                <li>A webinar packed with tips they can use immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Make it SO DAMN GOOD they can’t afford to say no. You’re collecting emails AND you are earning trust.
            </p>
            <p>
                And trust converts. It happened to me. It happened to my clients. Maybe now… maybe in 20 days, in 60, or in 90 days. When you build trust with your ideal leads, you WILL close them SOMEDAY.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">Step Two: Nurture Like a Pro</h4>
            <p>
                Great. You’ve got some leads now. But here’s the deal: letting it sit there does absolutely nothing. This step is where you turn “potential” into profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                To nurture your leads, write content "specific to them”. A good place for this is email campaigns. I’ll come up with a guide for that if this passes EoM’s checks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Simply - Write emails that feel personal, <strong>follow up till they buy..or DIE</strong>, and guide them straight to the sale.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">Need proof?</p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Companies that nurture leads see a 50% increase in sales-qualified leads at 33% lower cost. (Source - Demand Gen Report)
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Simply, you get people who’ll be begging to buy from you, and you don’t have to spend any extra money for that.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">Here’s a killer sequence that you can do over 14 days:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Welcome Email:</strong> Introduce yourself and deliver the promised content. Be warm, be human.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>4 Follow-Up Emails:</strong> Share quick tips and resources related to their interest. Build a connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>3 Offer Emails:</strong> After giving them value, make them an offer they can’t walk away from.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p className="text-base">All I’ve said above isn't some fluffy theories mixed together.</p>
            <p className="text-base">It’s backed by hard data, and my experience.</p>

            <p className="text-base">
                It’s clear that 2-Step Lead Gen methods MULTIPLY your investment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                I’ve seen my clients get 3x more leads within 2-3 months after we’ve set this up for them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Who Is This Method For?</h3>
            <p className="text-base">
                This method is perfect for anyone who needs “high-quality” leads...

            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Here are a few examples of how businesses can make this method work for them:
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                First, start with putting valuable content online (blogs and social media are good places to start)
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Coaches and Consultants:</strong> Share actionable pieces like “5 Productivity Hacks for Entrepreneurs” or “The Top Mistakes Holding Back New Leaders.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SaaS Companies:</strong> Create guides like “How Our Software Saves You 10 Hours a Week” or comparison charts such as “X vs. Competitor: Which Fits Your Team Better?”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>E-Commerce Brands:</strong> Publish lists like “Top 10 Products for [Your Target Audience]” or tips like “How to Get The Most Out Of [Your Product] Every Day.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Write blogs like “What to Look for in a [Your Service] Provider” or offer checklists such as “10 Must-Dos Before Booking [Your Service].”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-base">
                Then in the end of each article or post, make sure you have a call to action that asks your viewers to give their emails/contact info (some businesses do better with WhatsApp, so choose what works best for you).
            </p>
            <p className="text-base">
                DO NOT skip this step. This is where you get leads. Now, nurture these leads and make them your clients.
