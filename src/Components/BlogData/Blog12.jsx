                <p className="mt-4 text-base font-sans">
                    AI is everywhere these days. It’s writing articles, creating images, film scripts, and even composing music.
                    So, you might be wondering, “Why should I bother hiring a content writer when I’ve got a ChatGPT subscription at my fingertips?”
                    It’s a fair question... and I’m here to break it down for you in this blog!
                </p>

                <div className="mt-6 space-y-6">

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold font-sans">1. The Human Touch</h2>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            First, let’s talk about the one thing AI can’t replace: ‘the human touch’. Sure, AI can put together some pretty impressive error-free sentences,
                            but can it really tell your story? Can it capture the authentic essence of your brand? Let’s dig a little deeper!
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold font-sans">2. A Story from the Heart</h2>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            Think about the last time a story really moved you. Maybe it was a book, a movie, or even an ad. What made it special? Chances are, it wasn’t just the words or images,
                            it was the emotion behind them, and that's all from a human!
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            Content agencies are filled with people who know how to turn emotions into words. They understand the subtleties of human experience and can translate that into content
                            that connects with your target audience. AI may be able to write a technically correct piece, but it lacks the emotion and authenticity that come from personal human experience.
                            Whether it’s a heartfelt brand campaign or a humorous social media post, the ability to tap into human emotion is what makes content memorable and drives engagement.

                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            Every brand has its own personality, and this is where the obvious difference comes in. It should have a distinct content style that reflects its personality,
                            which might be quirky, professional, friendly, or bold. A content writer will work with you to get to know your brand inside out. They will listen to you, discuss your
                            targets and objectives, and they will work towards nailing down your brand's voice and values. AI on the other hand is being trained using datasets. It can certainly mimic styles,
                            but it will never be able to grasp and respond to your brand identity in the same way that a human can.

                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            The world is unpredictable. Trends change, events happen, and suddenly your content strategy needs to change! AI is great at following instructions, but what happens
                            when the game plan changes? We as humans have a unique ability to understand context and adapt to the unexpected. That's where AI falls short; it needs our guidance to navigate
                            our constantly evolving world.

                    <div>
                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold font-sans">5. AI is a Tool, Not a Creator</h2>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            AI is brilliant at analyzing massive data, suggesting new trends, or generating creative first drafts to overcome writer’s block. However, it lacks contextual logic, cultural nuances,
                            and brand-specific subtleties. For example, AI might suggest a hot trend that has no connection with your brand’s tone. Without human oversight, this can lead to tone-deaf or even damaging content.
                            A content writer uses AI as a collaborative assistant, not a replacement for their content. They will use its capabilities to save some time on research or repetitive tasks,
                            but bring in human expertise to ensure that the final product feels authentic and aligned with your brand.

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold font-sans">6. Quality over Quantity</h2>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            AI may create hundreds of blog posts within a second, but the volume doesn’t guarantee success. Most of these machine-generated pieces lack context and logical thinking,
                            leading your brand to sound vague or inconsistent. A human writer, on the other hand, researches deeply and consults credible sources before carefully choosing words that resonate deeper with your target audience.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                            Additionally, AI may autocorrect and fix the content based on its assumption about your intent, which at times leaves you with results that are laughable or simply confusing.
                            Imagine a good-intentioned AI turning a simple phrase into an absurd one due to its inability to understand intent! A human writer's attention to detail will ensure that your content remains free of errors, authentic, and true to your brand's voice.
                        </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold font-sans">My Final Thoughts for You!</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                        AI is an excellent tool to improve content creation. It saves time, gives insight, and can spark killer ideas. However, if the content needs to be meaningful, emotional, and representative of the brand, nothing beats human expertise.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2 text-base font-sans">
                        So, hire a writer who can navigate through AI responsibly with their human writing experience, ensuring your content stands out for all the right reasons!
