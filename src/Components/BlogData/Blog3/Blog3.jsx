        </h3>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700 mt-2">
          The <strong>SIDBI Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS)</strong> is a
          cornerstone initiative introduced by the Government of India in June
          2016 with an initial corpus of INR 10,000 crore. Its primary objective
          is to facilitate capital availability for Indian startups and catalyze
          private investments. However, what makes this fund unique is its
          structure—it does not directly invest in startups but instead channels
          funds through{" "}
          <strong>SEBI-registered Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs)</strong>,
          commonly referred to as “daughter funds.” These daughter funds, in
          turn, invest in high-potential startups.

          </li>
          <li>
            The fund creates a <strong>multiplier effect</strong>: When SIDBI
            commits to a daughter fund, it incentivizes private investors to
            also invest, thereby increasing the total pool of available capital.

            The initiative is designed to support startups at various stages,
            whether they are in the early phase, growth phase, or expansion
            stage. This flexibility ensures that startups across sectors can
            benefit from the scheme.
